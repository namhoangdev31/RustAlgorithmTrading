From a 5,394% “Profit” to a Genuinely Robust ML System

If you’ve spent any time in the world of online trading, you’ve seen them: articles and videos promising spectacular returns with a “secret” combination of indicators. They show you a backtest on a hot stock like TSLA, and the equity curve goes straight to the moon.

We recently came across one such article: “Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average and ATR Long Position Strategy.” It presented a compelling idea: use the adaptive KAMA for trend-following and the ATR for volatility-based risk control. The results on TSLA were staggering: a 5,394% profit, crushing buy-and-hold.

But as experienced engineers, we know that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. So, we asked the crucial question: Does this strategy hold up under a rigorous, professional backtesting process?

This is the story of how we took that promising-but-flawed idea, subjected it to the robust testing of our open-source framework, AlphaSuite, and transformed it into a genuinely profitable machine learning strategy.

Part 1: The Inevitable Disappointment
Our first step was to replicate the article’s rule-based logic within AlphaSuite. The rules were simple:

Enter: When the price is above KAMA and volatility (ATR %) is within a “calm” range.
Exit: When the price crosses below KAMA or volatility spikes.
We ran this against QQQ using a standard walk-forward analysis. This method, unlike the article’s full-dataset optimization, simulates real-world trading by training on past data and testing on unseen future data.

The results were… underwhelming. The strategy barely made any money and had a Sharpe ratio near zero.

Why the massive difference?

The Overfitting Trap: The original article optimized its parameters on the entire historical dataset. This is a cardinal sin in quantitative finance called curve-fitting. The “perfect” parameters were tailored with perfect hindsight, making the results completely unrealistic.
Unrealistic Risk Management: The original backtest was simplistic, likely using an “all-in” approach. Our framework enforces disciplined position sizing and stop-losses, which prioritizes capital preservation over chasing lottery-ticket returns.
Cherry-Picking: The article highlighted extreme momentum stocks like TSLA and MSTR. A robust strategy must work across different assets and market conditions, not just on a few outliers.
The verdict was clear: the original rule-based strategy, as presented, was not viable for real-world trading.

Part 2: The Pivot to Machine Learning
Instead of abandoning the core concept, we decided to pivot. The idea of combining an adaptive trend (KAMA) with a volatility filter (ATR) was still sound. The problem was the rigid, over-optimized rules.

What if, instead of hard-coding rules, we used these indicators as features for a machine learning model to learn from?

This transformed our approach:

Feature Engineering: We created a set of normalized features to describe the market state.
Target Labeling: We defined what a “good” trade looks like using the Triple-Barrier Method.
Training the Model: We used the integrated ML pipeline in AlphaSuite to train a LightGBM model to find winning patterns.
The strategy was no longer a brittle set of “if-then” statements. It was now a flexible system capable of learning and adapting.

The Devil is in the Details: Key Calculations
To truly understand the transformation, let’s look at the code. The journey from a flawed rule to a robust feature involved several critical calculations.

## Engineering Robust Features

The biggest leap came from how we created features. Raw indicator values are often useless for models learning from long-term data. For example, a MACD value of $2.00 is huge when a stock is at $50, but meaningless when it’s at $500.

We solved this by normalizing the features, creating signals that are independent of the price level.

# Normalizing MACD by price to make it comparable over time
data['feature_macdhist'] = data['macd_hist'] / data['close']

# Scaling RSI to a consistent 0-1 range
data['feature_rsi'] = data['rsi'] / 100.0

# Calculating the percentage distance from a moving average
data['feature_price_kama_dist'] = (data['close'] / data['kama']) - 1
This gives the model a consistent signal to learn from, whether it’s looking at data from 2005 or 2025.

## Defining a “Win” with the Triple-Barrier Method

How do we teach the model what a good trade is? We use the “Triple-Barrier Method.” For each potential trade, we set three barriers into the future:

A profit target (e.g., 3x the Average True Range)
A stop-loss (e.g., 3x the Average True Range)
A time limit (e.g., 15 days)
The first barrier hit determines the outcome.

# Simplified logic for labeling a trade
profit_target = entry_price + (atr_at_entry * profit_target_multiplier)
stop_loss = entry_price - (atr_at_entry * stop_loss_multiplier)

# Look into the future N bars
future_bars = data.loc[i:].iloc[1:eval_bars + 1]

# Check if profit target was hit
pt_hit_mask = future_bars['high'] >= profit_target
pt_hit_date = future_bars.index[pt_hit_mask].min()

# Check if stop loss was hit
sl_hit_mask = future_bars['low'] <= stop_loss
sl_hit_date = future_bars.index[sl_hit_mask].min()

# A win occurs only if the profit target is hit before the stop loss.
if pd.notna(pt_hit_date) and (pd.isna(sl_hit_date) or pt_hit_date < sl_hit_date):
    target.loc[i] = 1.0  # Win
else:
    target.loc[i] = 0.0  # Loss (stop-loss or time-out)Part 3: The Results — From Hype to a Real Edge
We ran the new ML strategy through the same rigorous walk-forward optimization on QQQ. The results were a world apart.

Sharpe Ratio: A solid 0.90
Total Return (Out-of-Sample): 376%
Max Drawdown: A very manageable -16.4%
Interestingly, when we ran a full in-sample backtest (using a single set of optimized parameters over the entire 25-year period), the strategy returned 791%, handily beating the 631% buy-and-hold return for the same period. This shows the strategy’s theoretical potential under a stable parameter set.

However, the more realistic 376% out-of-sample return is the number we trust. While it underperformed a perfect-hindsight buy-and-hold strategy across the test periods, it achieved this with a fraction of the risk. It successfully navigated major market downturns, preserving capital while a passive investor would have faced devastating losses. This is the trade-off at the heart of professional strategy design: sacrificing some potential upside for a massive reduction in risk.

But the most fascinating insight came from the feature importance plot, which tells us what the model “thinks” is most important:

feature_atr_pct (Highest Importance): The model's most critical factor was market volatility. It learned to be highly selective, confirming the original article's core idea in a data-driven way.
feature_price_sma200_dist: The long-term trend filter was the second most important, proving the model learned not to fight the primary trend.
feature_macdhist: The MACD histogram, a measure of momentum acceleration, was also highly valued for timing entries.
The model had validated the initial concept but had discovered a far more nuanced and robust way to execute it.

Your Turn: Stop Curve-Fitting, Start Building
This journey from a flawed rule-based strategy to a robust ML system highlights the core principles of modern quantitative research:

Be Skeptical: Treat “perfect” backtests with extreme suspicion.
Test Rigorously: Walk-forward analysis and realistic risk management are non-negotiable.
Iterate and Adapt: Don’t be afraid to pivot from a rigid idea to a more flexible, data-driven approach.
This entire process was made possible by our open-source project, AlphaSuite, a Python framework designed for the rapid development and rigorous testing of quantitative trading strategies. It provides the tools — from data processing and feature engineering to walk-forward optimization and ML integration — that allow you to focus on what matters: finding a genuine, durable edge. As a follow-up, we published a step-by-step guide to walk you through the entire workflow, from data preparation to signal generation, using the very same KamaAtrStrategy as example.
