How machine learning regime detection achieved a 1.00 Sharpe ratio with half the drawdown of buy-and-hold

In the world of quantitative trading, one of the most persistent challenges is understanding when market dynamics shift. Are we in a bull market? A correction? A period of high volatility that requires caution? Rather than trying to predict these shifts after the fact, what if we could systematically detect regime changes in real-time and adjust our positions accordingly?

This is the premise behind regime-switching strategies, and today I’m sharing the results of a production-level implementation using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) that achieved compelling risk-adjusted returns over a 5-year period.

The Core Insight: Markets Have Distinct “Regimes”
Markets don’t behave uniformly over time. Some periods are characterized by steady upward momentum with low volatility. Others exhibit choppy, range-bound behaviour. And occasionally, we experience sharp selloffs with elevated volatility.

The key insight is this: if we can systematically identify which regime we’re in, we can adjust our exposure accordingly — going long during favourable conditions and moving to cash during unfavourable ones.

The Strategy Architecture
Feature Engineering: What Defines a Regime?
Rather than using arbitrary technical indicators, I focused on two fundamental characteristics that capture market state:

## Yang-Zhang Volatility (20-day window)

Unlike simple historical volatility that only uses closing prices, the Yang-Zhang estimator is a sophisticated range-based measure that incorporates:

Overnight gaps (Open vs previous Close)
Intraday movement (High-Low ranges)
Open-to-Close dynamics
The formula combines three components:

σ²_YZ = σ²_overnight + k·σ²_open_close + (1-k)·σ²_Rogers_Satchell
This gives us a more comprehensive view of realized volatility, capturing information that close-to-close calculations miss. Why it matters: Bullish regimes typically show higher volatility (counterintuitively), while choppy markets show moderate volatility.

## SMA 20 vs 50 Crossover (Normalized)

Instead of a binary crossover signal, I use a continuous normalized difference:

Signal = (SMA_20 - SMA_50) / SMA_50
This captures both the direction and magnitude of trend strength. Positive values indicate bullish momentum, negative values indicate bearish momentum, and the magnitude tells us how strong that momentum is. Normalization makes it scale-invariant — it works the same whether SPY is at $300 or $600.

Critical: Both features are lagged by 1 day to prevent look-ahead bias. When we generate a signal at Close[t], we use features from t-1.

The Algorithm: Gaussian Mixture Models
Why GMM Instead of HMM?
While Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are popular for regime detection, I chose Gaussian Mixture Models for several reasons:

Simplicity: GMM assumes features come from a mixture of Gaussian distributions without modelling temporal transitions
Interpretability: Each cluster centre represents a distinct market state
Robustness: No need to model transition probabilities, which can be unstable
Speed: Faster training and convergence
GMM works by assuming our 2D feature space (volatility × momentum) contains K=3 clusters representing Bearish, Neutral, and Bullish regimes. The algorithm finds:

Cluster centres: The “typical” feature values for each regime
Covariances: How features vary within each regime
Mixing weights: How common each regime is
Walk-Forward Validation: Preventing Overfitting
Here’s where most backtests fail: they use future data to make past decisions.

This strategy uses strict walk-forward validation:

Expanding window training: Start with 252 days (1 year) of data
Fit models: Train StandardScaler → GMM on historical data only
Create regime mapping: Analyse which clusters had positive forward returns in the training period
Freeze models: Lock scaler, GMM, and regime labels
Predict forward: Use frozen models for next 63 days (1 quarter)
Refit: Expand window and repeat
This resulted in 20 refits over the backtest period, with all clusters remaining sufficiently populated (≥10 samples).

Regime Assignment Logic:

Calculate forward returns for each cluster in training data
Sort clusters by mean forward return
Assign: Lowest → Bearish, Middle → Neutral, Highest → Bullish
This ensures regime labels reflect actual future returns, not arbitrary technical criteria.

Trading Logic: When to Be Long
The strategy employs a long-only approach:

Long: When in Bullish regime (407 days, 27.9%)
Cash: When in Neutral (555 days, 38.0%) or Bearish (246 days, 16.8%)
Execution mechanics:

Signal generated at Close[t] based on current regime
Execution at Open[t+1] (realistic slippage)
Portfolio marked-to-market at Close[t+1]
All returns calculated Close-to-Close for consistency
Commission: 0.1% per trade (10 bps)
With only 38 trades over 5+ years (19 buys, 19 sells), the strategy shows remarkably low turnover, minimizing transaction costs and taxes.

Key Takeaways

## Comparable Returns, Half the Risk

The strategy delivered 107% returns, nearly matching SPY’s 109%. But here’s the critical difference: it achieved this with 11.25% volatility vs SPY’s 20.08%. That’s a 44% reduction in volatility.

## Exceptional Risk-Adjusted Performance

The Sharpe ratio of 1.00 vs SPY’s 0.63 represents a 59% improvement. For every unit of risk taken, the strategy generated substantially more return.

## Dramatically Reduced Drawdowns

Maximum drawdown of -14.68% vs -34.10% for SPY. During the 2020 COVID crash and 2022 bear market, the strategy’s regime detection moved to cash, avoiding the worst declines.

## Outperformance vs Global Equities

Against URTH (global benchmark), the strategy showed clear alpha:

Excess return: +31.44%
Excess CAGR: +3.18%
Sharpe advantage: +0.50
Limitations and Considerations

## Sample Period Matters

The backtest period (2019–2024) included:

The 2020 COVID crash (regime detection worked well)
The 2022 bear market (moved to cash appropriately)
Multiple regime transitions
Limited to one business cycle
Caveat: Performance in prolonged sideways markets (e.g., 2000s) remains untested.

## Regime Detection Lag

The strategy detects regime changes but doesn’t predict them. There’s an inherent lag:

We observe feature changes
GMM classifies current state
We act on classification
This means we might miss the first few days of a new regime or hold slightly too long.

## Opportunity Cost in Bull Markets

Being in cash 55% of the time means missing gains during:

Neutral regime rallies
Early stage recoveries before Bullish classification
In strong bull markets (e.g., 2023–2024), buy-and-hold would outperform. This is a feature, not a bug — we accept lower returns in exchange for dramatically reduced risk.

## Three-Regime Framework

The K=3 cluster assumption is somewhat arbitrary. Markets might have:

More than 3 distinct regimes
Overlapping regime characteristics
Regime subtypes (e.g., “low-vol bullish” vs “high-vol bullish”)
However, increasing K introduces complexity and risks overfitting.

## Parameter Sensitivity

Key parameters that could affect performance:

SMA windows (20 vs 50)
Yang-Zhang window (20 days)
Refit frequency (63 days)
Minimum cluster samples (10)
While these were chosen based on theory and common practice, they weren’t exhaustively optimized (by design, to avoid overfitting).

Extensions and Future Work
Several promising directions to explore:

## Multi-Asset Regime Detection

Apply the same framework to:

International equities (EEM, EFA)
Fixed income (TLT, IEF)
Commodities (GLD, DBC)
Crypto (BTC, ETH)
Different assets might exhibit different regime structures.

## Dynamic Position Sizing

Instead of binary long/cash:

100% long in Bullish
50% long in Neutral
0% long in Bearish
This could capture some upside in neutral regimes while maintaining risk control.

## Regime-Based Portfolio Allocation

Use regime detection for:

Stocks vs bonds allocation
Risk-on vs risk-off positioning
Factor rotation (value vs growth)

## Incorporate Additional Features

Potential regime indicators:

Credit spreads (HYG vs LQD)
Term structure (2Y-10Y spread)
Put/call ratios
Market breadth (AD line)
Sentiment indicators

## Long/Short Implementation

Enable short positions in Bearish regimes:

Long in Bullish
Cash in Neutral
Short in Bearish
This could enhance returns but adds complexity and risk.

Conclusion: The Case for Regime-Aware Investing
The results speak for themselves: matching market returns with half the volatility and less than half the drawdown.

But beyond the numbers, this strategy represents a fundamentally different approach to investing. Rather than being fully invested at all times (traditional buy-and-hold) or trying to time the market based on predictions (tactical trading), regime detection offers a middle path:

Respond to observable market conditions, don’t predict the future.

When volatility and momentum characteristics suggest favourable conditions, be long. When they don’t, step aside. It’s that simple.

The financial industry has long recognized that returns are non-stationary — volatility clusters, trends persist, correlations break down. Yet most retail investors are told to “stay invested” regardless of conditions. Regime-switching strategies acknowledge that not all market environments are created equal.

For investors willing to accept lower returns in raging bull markets in exchange for sleeping soundly during crashes, regime detection strategies deserve serious consideration.

    WALK-FORWARD PROCESS (NO LOOK-AHEAD):
    =====================================
    For each prediction window:
```

## TRAIN SCALER: Fit StandardScaler on expanding training window

       → Learn mean/std of features from past data only
    

## TRAIN GMM: Fit GaussianMixture on normalized training features

       → Learn cluster centers and covariances from past data
    

## CREATE REGIME MAPPING: Analyze forward returns in training period

       → Determine which cluster = Bearish, Neutral, Bullish
       → CRITICAL: Use only training period forward returns
       → ROBUST: Handle underpopulated clusters (min sample threshold)
    

## FREEZE MODELS: Lock scaler, GMM, and regime mapping

    

## PREDICT: Use frozen models to predict regime for next period

    

## REFIT: After N days, repeat process with expanded training set

    
    This ensures predictions at time T use ONLY information available at T-1.

Final Thoughts
In an era of increasing market volatility and uncertainty, strategies that dynamically adjust risk exposure will likely outperform static approaches on a risk-adjusted basis.

The 1.00 Sharpe ratio achieved here isn’t magic — it’s the result of:

Sound feature engineering (volatility + momentum)
Appropriate algorithm selection (GMM)
Rigorous validation (walk-forward)
Disciplined execution (systematic rules)
As more investors embrace quantitative approaches, the key differentiator won’t be finding alpha (increasingly difficult) but managing risk intelligently.
```

Regime detection is one powerful tool in that arsenal.
